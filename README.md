# Instructions

On the right side of the screen, the first four buttons from the top add shapes to the canvas.

When you add a shape, it shows the shape you added on the left side of the screen.
Each shape on the left side of the screen can be selected by pressing the radio button to the right of the delete button.

When a shape is selected, it shows blue circles that you can click and drag to edit the shapes.

Most of them are intuitive, but the blue circle right beside the parabola's vertex can be used to switch a parabola from being a vertical to horizontal.

The fifth button copies a command to your clipboard that you can paste into the console of the [Desmos graphing calculator website](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) to import the shapes there.

Once it's copied to your clipboard, head to the Desmos graphing calculator and open the developer tools.

Alternatively, you can press the keyboard shortcut ctrl+shift+i and click the console tab.

After that, you should type "allow pasting" (without the quotes) into your console and hit enter.
Don't worry, it's safe! If you're not convinced, you can read the source code.
