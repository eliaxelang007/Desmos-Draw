On the right side of the screen, the first four buttons from the top add shapes to the canvas.

The fifth button copies a command that you can paste into the console of the [Desmos graphing calculator website](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) to import the shapes into there.

When you add a shape, it shows the shape you added on the left side of the screen.
Each shape on the left side of the screen can be selected by pressing the radio button to the right of the delete button.

Most of them are intuitive, but the blue circle right beside the parabola's vertex can be used to switch a parabola from being a vertical to horizontal.
